# Java Magical Creature Zoo Manager

## A fantastical app for managing fantastical creatures comforts!

An old project from my coding bootcamp days that has been dusted off for the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Lots of poorly informed decisions in this code as I learned java at the time, I'm going to refactor it and try to update it with what I know now.

I've hardly used Java since graduating the coding bootcamp so this will be a refresh while also learning how to use the Intellij Idea IDE.
